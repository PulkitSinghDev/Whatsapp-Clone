## Inspiration
In the early times There was no way of communication
## What it does
So here we have created a whatsapp clone so that our anscestors can easily communicate with each other
## How we built it
Java, Git, Github, Firebase, Linode
## Challenges we ran into
There were no mobiles in that time 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
All features worked properly on cloud
## What's next for Whatsapp for ancestors
Once we get Time Machine we will send them this app with a mobile to connect with each other
